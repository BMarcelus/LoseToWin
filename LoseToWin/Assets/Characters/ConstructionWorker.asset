  texts:
  - I am a construction worker
  - I do the construction
  - I wear the yellow vest for visibility. So that people can see that I am working
    in construction.
  - I hold this hexagonal sign to remind people that it is illegal to steal real stop
    signs.
  - 'Sometimes I think about what it would be like to make a better world. '
  - I guess you could say this revolution has been pretty... built up.
